Word Game

This is a pass and play word game where players take turns coming up with English 
words that include a random substring.

How it works:
1. Players enter their names and decide how many lives everyone starts with.
2. Each round, the game picks a random substring from a word.
3. Players take turns entering any English words that contain the substring:
   - If you fail to provide a valid word, 
   or your word doesn’t include the substring, you lose a life.
4. Longest word: Gain a life, Shortest word: Lose a life.
5. Elimination:
   - Players are out of the game when their lives hit zero.
   - The game ends when there’s only one player left or everyone is out.

6. Features:
- Choose your difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) to set how long the substrings are.
- Words are validated to ensure they are real and include the substring.
- At the end, all the words used by the players are saved to a file, `words_used.txt`.
- Uses words from `words_alpha.txt` as a word bank.
